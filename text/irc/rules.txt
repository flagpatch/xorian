Rules to being in #Xorian
1. Know how to act
  As a member of #Xorian, you are responcible for knowing what is socially acceptable or not. There is no way to turn this into a specific set of rules. You should know what is right and wrong and you should not join us if you do not know otherwise.
  
2. Follow EsperNet's TOS
  You are required to comply with EsperNet's code of conduct and terms of service. We host our channel on EsperNet which means you are required to comply with the rules of the server we are running the channel on.

3. Do not cause serious debate.
  Some debate is fine, other than politics which might get you banned. Keep debate at a minimum and any debate must be kept at a hospitable level, any hostile or otherwise antagonistic debate can get you banned for a day or some other punishment based upon severity of the dispute.
  
This is the rules, just have common sense about how to act and you are set.
